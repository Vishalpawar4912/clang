1. Write a program to accept, display and print the sum of elements of each row of a matrix.

2. Write a program to accept a matrix A of size m X n and store its transpose in matrix B. display matrix B write separate functions.

3. Write a program to add and multiply two matrices. Write a seperate functions to accept, display, add and multiply the matrices. 
   perform necessary checks before adding and mulitplying the matrices.

4. Write a menu driven program to perform the following operatins on square matrix.
   write a seperate functions for each option.
   1. Check if the matrix is symmetric.
   2. Display the trace of matrix(Sum of diagonal elements).
   3. Check if the matrix is an upper triangular matrix.
   4. Check if the matrix is a lower triangular matrix.
   5. Check if it is an identity matrix.

5. To accept a m x n matrix and generate a m + 1 x n + 1 matrix such that the mth row contains sum of elements of corresponding columns 
   and the nth column contains sum of elements of corresponding rows. 
   Example. 
               Input                 Output 
            1   2   3           1    2    3    6
            4   5   6           4    5    6    15
