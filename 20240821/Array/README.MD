3. To accept n numbers in an array and shift all negative numbers to the end of the array. (Do not sort the array)

   Output : 5  10  45  12  -2  -36  -9

4. To accept n numbers and store them in an array such that they are in the sorted order. (Without sorting)

5. To find the union and intersection of two arrays.
   Example.
   A = {1, 2, 5, 7}  B = {1, 4, 7}
   Union = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
   Intersection = {1, 7}
