1. Write a program that accepts a string and generates all its permutations. for ex., ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.

2. Check whether a string is a Palindrome. A Palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and reverse.
   ex., Malayalam is a Palindrome.

3. Display a number in words. for ex., 6719 will be displayed as Six Thousand Seven Hundred Nineteen.

4. Display Number in words. The same task can be done using another logic.

5. Write a program to copy one string to another without using standard library function. Use dynamic memory allocation to accept string.

6. Write a program in C , which will accept a string and copies it into another string such that only alternate characters are copied.
    (Use Pointers). ex., if S1 = "Hello World", then S2 = "HloWrd".

7. Write a C program that accepts n words and displays them in dictionary order.

8. Program which replaces all occurrences of a character in a string by another character. 
   The string and characters are accepted as command line arguments.

9. Program which encrypts a string by an integer key. The string and key are accepted as command line arguments. 
   The key will be sorted as a string. Hence we have to convert it to an integer.
