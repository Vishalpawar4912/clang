1. Write Functions for the following :
    1. char *upper(char *s) : converts a string to uppercase and returns the converted string.
    2. char *lower(char *s) : converts a string to lowercase and returns the converted string.
    3. int count(char *s, char ch) : returns the number of times char ch occurs in string s.
    4. char *replace(char *s, hcar ch1, char ch2) : replacers all occurances of ch1 in string s by ch2 and returns the converted string.
    5. char *encrypt(char *s, int key) : encrypts string s by value key. Returns the encrypted string.
    6. char *expand(char s, char t) : which converts characters like newline and tab into visible sequences like \n \t as it copies 
       string s to string t. Returns string t.
    7. int compare(char *s1, char *s2) : compares two strings and returns difference between them and 0 if equal.

2. Write a program to accept n strings and display the longest string.

3. Accept a string and display it in the following forms :
    If string is ABCDE , the Output should be, 
    ABCDE   BCDEA   CDEAB   DEABC   EABCD   ABCDE

4. Write a program to accept a sentence, seperate out the words and display the words in the alphabetical order.
    Eg.,        This is a string
    Output      a
                is
                string
                This

5. Write a program to accept an integer and display it in the form of words.
    Eg.,    9702 : Nine Thousand Seven Hundred Two.

6. WAP to accept a string and display it such that all white spaces are display as visible characters.
    space       \s
    tab         \t
    newline     \n

7. Write a menu driven program using string library functions for :
    1. length of string         2. comparing two strings

8. Write a recursive function to calculate length of string.

9. Write a C Program function to display string in the reverse order.(with and without using standard library function).

10. Write a recursive function to display string in the reverse order.(with and without using standard library function).

11. Write a C program to check whether string is Palindrome. A Palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and reverse e.g., MADAM.

12. Write a C program which accepts n names and display them and search for a particular name.

13. Write a C program to copy one string to another without using stndard library function. use dynamic memory allocation to accept string.

14. Write a C program that accepts n words and displays them in dictionary order.

15. Write a program to accept a string and character as command line arguments and replace each occurance of 
   character in the string by the given character.

16. Write a program to accept two strings as command line arguments and concatenate the second to the first.
