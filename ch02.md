### **Step 1: Wireframing**

Wireframing is the process of creating low-fidelity sketches of the app's interface. It helps in visualizing the layout, navigation, and core components without getting into design details.

#### **Tools for Wireframing:**
- **Figma:** A popular tool for wireframing and design that allows for real-time collaboration.
- **Sketch:** Great for macOS users, with a focus on UI/UX design.
- **Balsamiq:** Simple, low-fidelity wireframes that focus on structure over aesthetics.

#### **Key Screens to Wireframe:**
1. **Login/Signup Screen:**
   - Input fields for username and password.
   - Option for social login (Google, Facebook).
   - Forgot password and signup links.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Overview of key metrics (e.g., unpaid maintenance fees, upcoming meetings).
   - Quick access buttons to major features (e.g., Maintenance, Guest Management).

3. **Maintenance Management:**
   - List of maintenance requests (with status indicators).
   - Buttons to add new requests, view details, and make payments.
   - Payment history and receipts.

4. **Meeting Management:**
   - Calendar view of upcoming meetings.
   - Details page for each meeting (agenda, time, participants).
   - Option to add or edit meetings (admin only).

5. **Guest Management:**
   - Form to pre-register guests (name, contact, expected arrival).
   - List of upcoming guests with a status indicator (arrived, not arrived).
   - Interface for watchmen to check in guests.

6. **Parcel Management:**
   - Logging new parcels with details (carrier, residentâ€™s name, time of arrival).
   - Notifications to residents.
   - Parcel pickup confirmation screen.

7. **Maintenance Schedule for Utilities:**
   - Schedule view for upcoming maintenance tasks.
   - Details page for each task (e.g., lift maintenance, water tank cleaning).
   - Notifications and reminders for upcoming tasks.

#### **Creating the Wireframes:**
- Start with a **rough sketch** on paper or whiteboard to outline each screen.
- Move to your chosen tool (e.g., Figma) and create digital wireframes.
- Focus on the **layout and user flow**, not colors or detailed design elements.
- Ensure **easy navigation** between screens, especially for key tasks like logging a maintenance request or notifying the watchman.

### **Step 2: Prototyping**

Once the wireframes are finalized, prototyping brings the wireframes to life, allowing you to simulate user interactions.

#### **Tools for Prototyping:**
- **Figma:** Allows you to turn your wireframes into interactive prototypes.
- **InVision:** Another popular tool for creating clickable prototypes.
- **Adobe XD:** Offers both design and prototyping features in one tool.

#### **Building the Prototype:**
1. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Link screens together based on user flow (e.g., tapping on "Maintenance Management" on the dashboard takes you to the maintenance screen).
   - Add interaction states (e.g., button presses, form submissions).

2. **User Flow Simulation:**
   - Simulate key user actions like registering a guest, making a maintenance payment, or viewing meeting details.
   - Ensure the flow is intuitive and requires minimal steps.

3. **Feedback and Iteration:**
   - Share the prototype with stakeholders (e.g., residents, committee members) to gather feedback.
   - Use the feedback to refine the design and user flow.
   - Iterate until the prototype meets user expectations and feels smooth to navigate.

#### **Tips for Effective Prototyping:**
- **Start simple:** Focus on core functionalities before adding complex interactions.
- **Test early and often:** Regular testing helps catch usability issues before they become costly to fix.
- **Gather diverse feedback:** Ensure feedback comes from a range of users (tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy).

### **Next Steps:**
- **Create Wireframes:** If you'd like, I can help you outline the wireframes in detail or suggest layouts for specific screens.
- **Build the Prototype:** Once wireframes are ready, we can move to prototyping and test the app's user flow.
- **Iterate:** Based on the prototype feedback, iterate and refine the design before moving to development.
