Set A . Apply all the three program development steps for the following examples. 

 1. Write a program to accept an integer n and display all even numbers upto n. 

 2. Accept two integers x and y and calculate the sum of all integers between x and y (both inclusive).

 3. Write a program to accept two integers x and n and compute x^n.

 4. Write a program to accept an integer and check if it is prime or not. 

 5. Write a program to accept a character, an integer n and display the next n characters.

 6. Write a program to accept an integer and count the number of digits and calculate sum of digits in the number. eg, Number = 1234 Output: Digits = 4, Sum = 10; 

 7. Write a program to accept an integer and reverse the number. Example: Input: 546, Output 645.

Set B. Apply all the three program development steps for the following examples.

 1. Write a program to display the first n Fibonacci numbers. (1 1 2 3 5 ……) 

 2. Write a program to accept real number x and integer n and calculate the sum of first n terms of the series x+ 3x+5x+7x+… 

 3. Write a program to accept real number x and integer n and calculate the sum of first n terms of the series 1/x + 2/x^2  + 3/x^3 + …

 4. Write a program to accept characters till the user enters EOF and count number of alphabets and digits entered.

 5. Write a program, which accepts a number n and displays each digit in words. Example: 6702 Output = Six-Seven-Zero-Two. (Hint: Reverse the number and use a switch statement) 

Set C. Write C programs to solve the following problems  

1. Write a program to accept characters from user till the user enters * and count the number of characters, words and lines enterd by the user. (Hint: Use a flag to count words. Consider delimiters like \n\t,;. and space for counting words).

2. Write a program which accepts a number and checks if the number is a palindrome (Hint number = reverse of number) 
Example:Input    :3472 Output : It is not a palindrome  number
        Input    :262, Output : It is a palindrome  

3. A train station A at 4.00 a.m. and travels at 80kmph. After every 30 minutes, it reaches a station where it halts for 10 minutes. it reaches its final destination B at 1.00 p.m.. Display a table showing its arrival and departure time at every intermediate station. also calculate the total distance between A and B.

4. A task 4 1/2 hours to complete. Two workers A and B start working on it and take turns alternately. A works for 25 minutes at a time and is paid Rs. 50, B works for 75 minutes at a time and is paid Rs. 150. Display the total number of turns taken by A and B, calculate their total amounts and also the total cost of the task.
